Workshop data
This section shows the data and the data sources we'll us in the workshop.

Natural Earth (~/materials/natural_earth)
The Natural Earth dataset is a free collection of vector and raster data published by the North American Cartographic Information Society to encourage mapping. In this workshop we will use the datasets Cultural, Physical and Raster in large scale (1:10m).

OpenStreetMap (~/materials/osm_mongolia)
OpenStreetMap is a free editable map database of the world. In this workshop we use a small excerpt of the huge OSM database focused on mongolia which is provided by the company geofabrik as a collection of single shapefiles.
