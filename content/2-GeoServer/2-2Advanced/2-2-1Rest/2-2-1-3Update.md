Updating a layer
Basically we can change every element of catalog by the use of the REST API. In the following example we will change the countries_rest layer's default output projection to EPSG:54009 (Mollweide projection).

Execute the following terminal command to update the layer countries_rest. (Note: Every update needs the property <enabled>true</enabled>

otherwise the catalog entry, in this case the layer, will be disabled and not be visible to any user!)

  $ curl \
    -v \
    -u admin:momo-ws \
    -XPUT \
    -H "Content-type: text/xml" \
    -d "<featureType>
          <enabled>true</enabled>
          <srs>EPSG:54009</srs>
          <projectionPolicy>REPROJECT_TO_DECLARED</projectionPolicy>
        </featureType>" \
    http://localhost/geoserver/rest/workspaces/momo-rest/datastores/db_momo_ws_rest/featuretypes/countries_rest
After this step has been confirmed as successfully finished with HTTP / 1.1 200 OK, we can then automatically calculate the new native and lat/lon bounding box of the layer by appending the parameter recalculate=nativebbox,latlonbbox to the REST URL:
  $ curl \
    -v \
    -u admin:momo-ws \
    -XPUT \
    -H "Content-type: text/xml" \
    -d "<featureType>
          <enabled>true</enabled>
        </featureType>" \
    http://localhost/geoserver/rest/workspaces/momo-rest/datastores/db_momo_ws_rest/featuretypes/countries_rest?recalculate=nativebbox,latlonbbox
Review that the layer has been updated correctly by opening the layer configuration in the GeoServer UI (Data ‚ù≠ Layers) and have a look at the subsection Coordinate Reference System and Bounding Boxes, which should contain your requested changes.


Finally have a look at the layer preview page and note, that the default SRS is set to EPSG:54009.
