Generate map tiles
Generally speaking, GWC applies two methods for creating cached map tiles:

On-the-fly processing: If a GWC layer is primarily requested by a client, the appropriate map tiles are rendered and subsequently stored in the GWC data directory. The next client, requesting the same layer on the same location receives a (much faster) response from the cache.
Preprocessing of map tiles: The tiles of a layer will be preprocessed and stored in a defined bounding box and in defined zoom levels along the given gridset. In contrast to the on-the-fly calculation, this method requires, depending on the available system resources, significantly more computing time, but all clients will receive a direct response from the cache.
With the following steps we'll preprocess the tiles and start the so called Seeding job.

Go to Tile Caching ‚ù≠ Tile Layers.
Find the layer momo:countries and select Seed/Truncate.


In the upcoming mask we can configure a GWC-task for seeding the layers countries. Here we can use the following configuration:
Number of tasks to use: 04
Type of operation: Reseed - regenerate all tiles (The option Seed - generate missing tiles would behave the same here as we haven't any cache present)
Grid Set: momo-4326
Format: image/png
Zoom start: 00
Zoom stop: 07


Click Submit.
In the same window the section List of currently executing tasks will be filled with the recent tasks and involves some basic informations about it.


Depending on your system resources the seeding tasks should not cover more than a few minutes. Click Refresh list to see if the tasks are finished or not.
