iles and gridsets
Tiles
GeoWebCache caches images retrieved from a WMS. The smallest unit of image cached is known as a tile. All tiles are assumed to be the same dimensions and are typically square (i.e. 256 pixels by 256 pixels). The tiles are stored in a rectangular grid, indexed by (x,y) coordinates. A z coordinate (zero-indexed) is used to denote the zoom level, resulting in each tile being indexed as a triplet (x,y,z).

Gridsets
Gridsets and gridsubsets refer to the spatial reference system of the layers served by GeoWebCache. When GeoWebCache makes a request to a WMS, it uses the gridset and gridsubset information to convert its internal tile index to a spatial request that the WMS will understand.

A gridset is a global definition (i.e. not layer-specific) specifying:

A spatial reference system.
A bounding box describing the extent, typically the maximum extent for the above reference system.
One of either a list of scale denominators, resolutions, or zoom levels.
The tile dimensions in pixels (constant for all zoom levels).
A gridsubset is a layer-specific definition specifying:

The gridset for the layer.
(Optional) The bounding box for that layer (which must be a subset of the extent of the gridSet).
(Optional) A list of zoom levels (which must be a subset of what is defined in the gridSet).
For further instructions have a look at the source of the above explanations, here.

Configure a new gridset
So, our first step will be to create a new gridset:

Go to Tile Caching ‚ù≠ Gridsets


Click Create a new gridset to create a new gridset and use the following options for the creation:
Name: momo-4326
Coordinate Reference System: Use the find-button to select EPSG:4326
Gridset bounds: Click Compute from maximum extent of CRS
Tile width in pixels: 512
Tile height in pixels: 512
Define grids based on: Select Scale denominators
Click Add zoom level to create a new zoom level. Enter the scale 300.000.000 and the name 0.
Once again click Add zoom level. You will see that the scale value is automatically cut into halves (150.000.000). Just enter the name 1 and repeat this step until you reached a total count of 8 zoom levels. The last scale value should be 2.343.750.
