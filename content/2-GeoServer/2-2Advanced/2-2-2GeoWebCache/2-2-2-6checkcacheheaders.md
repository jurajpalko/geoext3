Checking the cache-headers
Finally we are going to inspect the response send from the GeoServer/GeoWebCache to the client in more detail. As soon as a layer is being cached by GeoWebCache, the response headers of single tile are extended by the following HTTP-headers:

Header	Description
geowebcache-cache-result	If the tile is delivered by the cache, the value is HIT otherwise it's MISS.
geowebcache-crs	The coordinate system of the tile.
geowebcache-gridset	The name of the underlying gridset.
geowebcache-tile-bounds	The bounding box of the tile.
geowebcache-tile-index	The index of the tile (x, y, z) in the gridset.
To check if these headers are set, we need to open the GeoServer user interface again:

Go to Tile Caching ‚ù≠ Tile Layers.
Find the layer momo:countries and select momo-4326 / png under Preview.


In the preview window/tab press F12 to open the browsers Developer Toolbar, activate the Network tab, select the Img subsection and reload the page to record the network activity.


Clear the list content with the Clear button ()
Zoom in to a location of your choice, find a WMS GetMap request in the developer toolbar and select it. Explore the right hand sided information panel and find the Response Headers section. In this you should find the headers looking similar the following ones:
  geowebcache-cache-result:HIT
  geowebcache-crs:EPSG:4326
  geowebcache-gridset:momo-4326
  geowebcache-tile-bounds:158.05400771985825,54.880289022796376,206.3474373941237,103.17371869706184
  geowebcache-tile-index:[7, 3, 3]
