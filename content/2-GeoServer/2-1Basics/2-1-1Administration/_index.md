Administration
This module will give you a brief introduction into the GeoServer administration frontend where we'll focus on the mainly used configuration settings. The basis structure of the following chapters is directly inspired by GeoServers frontend composition (Note: The Data and Tile Caching sections will be treated in the particular chapters Publishing and GeoWebCache).
